### Update on Arithmetic Operation Components

- I've integrated the **properties window** and embedded **node definitions** into the code generation logic.
- Now, only the **code generation testing** part is pending.
- Next, I will **test the generated code** to ensure it works correctly and reflects the logic defined in the properties window.
