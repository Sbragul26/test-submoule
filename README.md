## JSON to Code Converter

### Project Overview
This project is a Code Generation Converter that transforms code written in JSON format into multiple programming languages including C, C++, and Python. It is designed to help developers auto-generate structured code from a unified JSON schema.

I have implemented the core logic in JavaScript, then converted it into TypeScript (.ts) . The resulting output can be obtained in file format, making it easy to download and use the generated code.

# Code Generation Converter: Prototype Completion Update

This tool successfully transforms code from a `JSON` schema into multiple programming languages, including **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **XML**.

The generated code outputs are stored in the `public/generated-code` directory, ready for download and use. This makes it highly convenient for developers to access and integrate the auto-generated, structured code into their projects.

## Next Steps
- Testing
- Optimization
- Adding support for more languages
